## Hand Detection Program using cvzone

The `HandDetection.py` script demonstrates how to perform hand detection using the `cvzone` library. It utilizes OpenCV to detect and track hands in real-time. The script provides functionalities such as gesture recognition, hand landmarks, and finger counting. This project is particularly useful for building interactive applications using hand gestures.

## Image Cropping

The `PointAndCrop.py` script showcases image cropping capabilities using OpenCV. It allows users to select a region of interest (ROI) on an image by defining points or drawing a bounding box. The script then crops the selected area, enabling users to extract specific portions of an image for further analysis or processing.

## Find RGB Color Code

The `RGBColorPicker.py` script enables users to find the RGB color code of a pixel in an image. By clicking on a specific location in the image, the script detects the RGB values of that pixel and displays them. This project is helpful for tasks that require color analysis or matching, such as designing computer vision systems for color-based object recognition.

## Screen Recording

The `ScreenRecording.py` script provides functionality for recording the screen using OpenCV. It captures the contents of the screen, including windows, applications, and user interactions, and saves it as a video file. This project can be utilized for creating tutorials, capturing gameplay, or any application that requires screen recording capabilities.

## Face Detection

The `faceDetection.py` script demonstrates face detection using OpenCV. It uses Haar cascades or deep learning-based approaches to identify faces in images or video streams. The script provides options for real-time face detection, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces, and even recognizing facial landmarks. This project is valuable for a wide range of applications, such as facial recognition, emotion detection, and access control systems.

## Reverse Video

The `reverseVideo.py` script reverses the frames of a video using OpenCV. It takes a video file as input and generates a new video file with the frames in reverse order. This project is useful for applications that require backward playback, such as analyzing videos in reverse or creating artistic effects.

## Skew Image Alignment with Contours

The `RotateSkewed-Contours.ipynb` script demonstrates how to align a skewed image using contours in OpenCV. The script automatically detects the orientation and skew of an image by finding the dominant contours. It then applies a transformation to correct the skew and align the image properly. This project is helpful for scenarios where images need to be aligned for better analysis or presentation.
